Hierarchy
Is where the game objects live. The game objects are the things thar are in our world, and we see our world in our scene world

We're going to add a **game object** by right clicking onthe hierarchy -> New 2D Object -> Sprites -> Circle

**Sprite**: A Sprite is a 2D graphic object obtained froma bitmap image

The difference between Project and Hierarchy is that Project are the things that live in your hard drive.

Our circle is a sprite, because it has a sprite renderer
