## Becoming a Desing Thinker
Before you can learn design thinking methods, you’ll need to understand the mindsets behind those methods. We’ll introduce basic terminology and more importantly, we’ll introduce what design thinking is and why you would want to use it.

### Desing Thinking Origins <a name="origins"></a>
Design thinking – the practice of considering a user’s experience throughout the process of creating and improving a product or service.

### Desing Thinking Terms and Practice <a name="terms"></a>
**User** – the person(s) who will be engaging with your product. They're the ones we are trying to understand. And this concept of understanding your user is core to desing thinking

**Empathy** – the ability to understand and share the feelings of another

**As-is** – the current state of a user’s experience. The good the bad and the ugly

**To-be** – the future state where a design thinking solution has been employed to a user’s pain to improve their experience

**Timebox** – The simple act of defining a length of time that a task should take and enforcing those parameters

To make our efforts count, we need to maintain an active approach to problem solving.
Use sticky notes so everyone can participate and not one person talking monopolizes the time to provide ideas. This a huge time saver

### Mindset vs Methods <a name="mindset"></a>
We'll be going over design thinking methods over this course, however methods are only a small part of design thinking, but just like any tool the intent behind their use is important, so the most important thing I can remind you is "you are not your user", you might share traits with your user, but it's up to you as a design thinker to try your hardest to separate your own biases and assumptions from the process and learn what your user truly needs, and learn what you user truly needs.

Assumptiosn in and of themselves are not bad, it's only when we do not acknowledge that we are assuming, or test those assumptions, that we see problems occur in design thinking.

Remind yourself to use empathy to keep your ego in check, because sometimes in the creative process we become attached to certain solutions that we are excited about but that don't truly address the user's needs.

## Becoming Acquainted with your User
Let’s start getting into the heads of our users. To do this, we’ll need to work with a couple of key bits of info and then we’ll begin applying that content to some of our design thinking methods.

### Empathy Maps <a name="maps"></a>
There are different empathy maps, the most important thing you can take away from using an empathy map is the sort of snapshot of our user mentality 

**Empathy Map** – a design thinking tool made of quadrants that is used to better understand the overarching traits of a user; typically outside of the context of their workflow.

**Archetype** – a collectively-inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image, etc., that is universally present, in individual psyches.

### Data Collection <a name="data"></a>

Information on your user needs to come from somewhere. Whether you are working from first-hand observation, or you already have analytics in place that will inform your future choices, you will need a source of info for your user to guide you. For example we can send out an online survey to users who fit this archetype, we can interview archetypical users directly or we can start with minimal information and build along the way

**Says quadrant**: This is where you place exact quotes.
**Does quadrant**: Explain what this person does with their daily lives, what's the user's life, considerations, like handling budgets, picking up kids, studying
**Thinkks quadrant**: Consider this Stable's sarahs inner monologue, treat this like quotes, this are things that the user may want to keep for themselves
**Feels quadrant**: Use emotive terms like happy because or frustrated with, there should be a prompting event that creates emotional reactions.

This will be a timed-box excercise

### Who is my User? <a name="who"></a>
We'll spend ~10 minutes writing down our basic thoughts on the behaviour of our user. Now comes a crucial step, putting our responses into buckets or in similar terms of type or concept.

There may be contradicting theme, and that's great don't force empathy maps to be too harmonious.

Whith this information you can construct youruser, what do they like, dislike and what makes the who they are.

## Understanding Your User "As-Is" Scenario
If an empathy map is a quick snapshot of your user, consider the as-is journey as the movie version. The as-is journey will bring to light areas of opportunity for you to improve the design. Sometimes, the areas of opportunity are small portions of the design. Other times, the opportunity could be the entire concept behind a design. Just remember: the key to a successful “as-is” will always be honesty.

### Journey Maps <a name="journey-maps"></a>
In the previous stage we learned how to create and read an empathy map. This map was a snapshot into our user's overall character, but in this stage we'll move into a more specific experience.

Journey maps vary from practicioner to practitioner, but all journey mao seeks to find a user's pain, their motivations. Or they seek out design opportunities to improve the experience.

Our journey map will be broken into four lanes, phases: doing, thinking and feeling.

**Journey Map** – a means of documenting a user’s experience from start to finish. Journey maps vary from practitioner to practitioner. All journey maps seek to find a user’s pain, motivations, or design opportunities for a user. This may be likened to an empathy map but viewed over the course of an experience rather than a general view of a user during a single point in time.

**Pain Points** – blockers in a user’s experience. These may be emotional, technological, process-based, or physical. The severity of pain will vary with each example.

### Phases <a name="phases"></a>
The phases of a jurney map are sort of like chapters titles of a book. In our example *StableSara* (User Persona) wants to purchase a weekender pass to EmmaCon, our fictitious rare gem conference. Stable Sara's phases when going through the checkout process are explore site, commit topurchase, active purchase and receive tickets. In these phases, we'll be able to isolate where her experience's pain point lie. The remaining threee sections of the journey map are doing, thinking, and feeling. You'll treat these sections similarly to how you would treat an empathy map, but as mentioned, you'll factor time an action.
